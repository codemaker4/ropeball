An abandoned JS 2d physics engine project.
This is a physics engine based around balls (vertecies) and ropes/rods (edges). The edges have never been implemented, but the nodes/balls have. The physics calculation is done on a seperate worker, whilst rendering is done on the main thread.
A demo is available at codemaker4.github.io/ropeball
